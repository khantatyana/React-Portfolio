            <p>Hello there, my name is Tatyana. I am a Web Developer leveraging my background in Economics & Management to build more intuitive user experiences on the web. Earned a certificate in Full Stack Flex from Columbia Engineering, where I developed skills in JavaScript - MERN ( MongoDB / Express / React / Node ) OOP, PWA, TDD and responsive web design. Known as an innovative problem-solver passionate about developing apps, with a focus on mobile-first design and development. With each project, my aim is to best engage my audience for an impactful user-experience. I applied aspects of UX and agile development in a recent project where I developed an app - Bones - Jazz events (MERN, passport, multer) with a user-friendly interface. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills in the future as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team in order to build better experiences on the web. Pursuing my master's of Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology.</p>
