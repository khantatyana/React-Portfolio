            <p>I am a Full-Stack Web Developer leveraging background in Economics & Management to build more intuitive user experiences on the web. Earned a certificate in Full Stack Flex (JavaScript) Development through Columbia Engineering where I developed skills in JavaScript - MERN - MongoDB / Express / React / Node - Jest JS / ES6 / jQuery, MySQL, PWA and responsive web design. Known as an innovative problem-solver passionate about developing apps, with a focus on mobile-first design and development. With each project, my aim is to best engage my audience for an impactful user-experience. I applied aspects of UX and agile development in a recent project where I worked in a team of five to develop an app - day trip planner that linked to the 400+ National Parks (based on NPS API) with a user-friendly interface. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills in the future as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team in order to build better experiences on the web.</p>
